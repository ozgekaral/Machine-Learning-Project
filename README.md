# End-to-End Prediction and Classification Tutorial on "Predict test scores of students" Dataset
#### This tutorial includes the entire flow from raw dataset to predictions and classifications with tuning, applied on "Predict test scores of students" dataset on Kaggle. I've conducted EDA, visualized the data, preprocessed it and applied regression and classification, evaluated the models and tuned the classification with GridSearchCV.
